## Just native elements

coolForm simply gives style to native HTML elements. Forget about fake controls!

## Based on Bootstrap

coolForm v2 was conceived to be compatible with Bootstrap 3. To accomplish this, coolForm v2's source code includes part of Bootstrap 3's source code. What part? Just the essential to style forms. Therefore, **you can use coolForm v2 with or without Bootstrap**. It works well either way!

## Browser compatibility

coolForm v2 works in all major browsers. The exception that proves the rule is legacy Internet Explorer, as usual.

While coolForm works fully perfect in IE10 and IE11, IE9 is not that cool and will render selects with the native dropdown arrow. Also keep in mind that CSS3 transitions are not supported in IE9. Regarding IE8, it's not cool at all. Nevertheless, a future release might include some jQuery magic to make IE8 cooler.

In a nutshell, the cool browsers are: **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **IE10+** (IE9 is almost completely cool), **Safari** and **Opera**.
